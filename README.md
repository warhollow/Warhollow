## 🧠 What Warhollow Is

Warhollow is a sovereign compute environment for AI and cryptographic workloads that require explicit governance and structured trust boundaries.

It operates on physically controlled hardware and uses enterprise-grade virtualization to isolate workloads within a unified control domain.

Warhollow does not eliminate trust.  
It narrows the trust surface and makes governance explicit.

---

## 🔒 Core Trust Model

Warhollow is structured around three foundational principles:

- **Unified Control Domain** — Governance spans both the physical substrate and the virtualization control plane.
- **Hypervisor-Enforced Isolation** — Workloads operate within isolated execution contexts.
- **Explicit Custody** — Data residency and infrastructure location are determined by physical control rather than cloud abstraction.

There is no external hyperscaler control plane provisioning, migrating, or replicating workloads.

## 🤖 AI & Cryptographic Workloads

Warhollow supports operator-controlled AI execution and cryptographic operations within isolated virtual environments.

AI inference runs inside a governed compute environment rather than through external API providers. Prompts, model execution, and outputs remain within the defined trust boundary of the environment.

Workload Owners retain control over:

- Application logic and model configuration  
- Cryptographic credentials inside their execution context  
- External data interfaces (e.g., API calls to owner-controlled data sources)  

Infrastructure governance remains structurally separate from workload execution.

Warhollow does not claim zero-knowledge guarantees or cryptographic impossibility of access.  
It reduces external dependencies and narrows where trust must reside.

---

## 💎 Value Orientation

Warhollow favors:

- Governance over abstraction  
- Discipline over spectacle  
- Explicit trust boundaries over diffuse provider dependence  

It is restrained by design.  
And deliberate by necessity.

---

## 🧩 Current Phase (Q1 2026)

- Architectural refinement and trust boundary validation  
- AI + cryptographic workload isolation testing  
- Substrate hardening and governance model iteration  

This repository contains conceptual materials only.  
No operational infrastructure details are disclosed.
