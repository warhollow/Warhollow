### 🧠 About
**Warhollow** is an **autonomous compute framework** for **private AI and cryptographic infrastructure**.  
It delivers **self-verifying, operator-controlled compute** for running LLMs, agents, and crypto workloads inside sealed, jurisdictionally contained environments.

Built between **open science** and **open consensus**, Warhollow defines a **third domain** — systems that prove integrity **without disclosure**.

Each node:
- Boots and attests through **TPM-bound identity**  
- Executes **LLM inference or agent workloads** inside encrypted enclaves  
- Uses **post-quantum hybrid cryptography**  
- Spins up, attests, and tears down under full operator control  
- Emits verifiable proofs of computation integrity  

**Goal:** compute that reasons, encrypts, and obeys only its operator.

### 🔒 Core Principles
- **Autonomous Control** – Infrastructure that governs itself: owned, attested, and sealed under its operator’s keys.  
- **Quantum-Resilient Security** – Hybrid cryptography protecting compute from interception — today and post-quantum.  
- **Controlled Spin-Up / Verified Tear-Down** – Every node lifecycle is provable, revocable, and irreversible.  
- **Zero Mediation** – No hyperscalers, telemetry, or delegated credentials.  
- **Legal Containment** – Operations confined to explicit jurisdictional and contractual boundaries.  
- **Proof-of-Integrity** – Each process can produce a cryptographic record of truth.

### 🤖 AI + Crypto Integration
- **Encrypted LLM Execution** – Run generative or analytic models in hardware-sealed isolation.  
- **Verifiable Compute** – Each workload signs its own existence.  
- **Private Intelligence** – AI that operates without data exposure, API leakage, or surveillance traces.  
- **Proof-of-Compute Ledger (Optional)** – Audit trail for attested inference or transactional logic.  

---

### 💎 Value Proposition
- **Private LLM hosting** — Fully contained AI inference and orchestration.  
- **Cryptographically verifiable compute** — Proofs for every action.  
- **PQ-ready** architecture hardened for future resilience.  
- **Provable lifecycle** — Spin-up, attest, tear-down under your jurisdiction.  
- **Zero-telemetry** stack for compliance, research, and confidentiality.

### 🧩 Current Phase
- Architecture and attestation protocols under refinement (Q4 2025 - 2026)  
- Optional Internal validator mesh in closed testing  
- Encrypted AI and crypto runtime in alpha simulation
