### 🧠 About
**Warhollow** is an **autonomous compute framework** for **private AI and cryptographic infrastructure**.  
It delivers **self-verifying, operator-controlled compute** for running LLMs, agents, and crypto workloads inside sealed, jurisdictionally-contained environments.

Built between **open science** and **open consensus**, Warhollow defines a **third domain** — systems that prove integrity **without disclosure**.

Each node:
- Boots and attests through **TPM-bound identity**  
- Executes **LLM or agent workloads** inside encrypted enclaves  
- Uses **post-quantum hybrid cryptography**  
- Spins up, attests, and tears down under full operator control  
- Emits verifiable proofs of computation integrity  

**Goal:** Compute that protects its operator, not its vendor.

---

### 🔒 Core Principles
- **Autonomous Control** — Infrastructure that governs itself: owned, attested, and sealed under its operator’s keys.  
- **Quantum-Resilient Security** — Hybrid cryptography protecting compute from interception — today and post-quantum.  
- **Controlled Spin-Up / Verified Tear-Down** — Every node lifecycle is provable, revocable, and irreversible.  
- **Zero Mediation** — No hyperscalers, telemetry, delegated credentials, or external IAM roles.  
- **Legal Containment** — Operations confined to explicit jurisdictional and contractual boundaries.  
- **Proof-of-Integrity** — Each process can produce a cryptographic record of truth.  

---

### 🤖 AI + Crypto Integration
- **Private Intelligence** — AI that runs under your keys, not someone else’s; isolated from cloud APIs and surveillance.  
- **Encrypted LLM Execution** — Generative and analytic models run in hardware-sealed isolation.  
- **Verifiable Compute** — Each workload signs its own existence and state.  
- **Proof-of-Compute Ledger (optional)** — Audit trail for attested inference or transactional logic.  

---

### 💎 Value Proposition
- **Private LLM hosting** — Fully contained AI inference and orchestration.  
- **Cryptographically verifiable compute** — Proofs for every action.  
- **PQ-ready architecture** — Algorithm agility and hybrid post-quantum encryption for forward security.  
- **Provable lifecycle** — Spin-up, attest, tear-down under your jurisdiction.  
- **Zero-telemetry stack** — Compliance without exposure.  

---

### 🧩 Current Phase
- Architecture and attestation protocols under refinement (**Q4 2025**)  
- Encrypted AI and crypto runtime in **alpha simulation**  
- **Internal Validator Mesh (optional)** — Nodes may operate independently or within a private mesh to cross-verify attestations and proofs.
