## 🧠 What Warhollow Is

**Warhollow** is a **sovereign, operator-exclusive compute framework** for **private AI**, **cryptographic workloads**, and **mission-grade computational autonomy**.

It delivers **self-verifying, silicon-rooted compute** inside sealed, jurisdictionally-contained environments — without cloud dependencies, telemetry, or external attestation services.

Warhollow operates between **open science** and **open consensus**, defining a **third domain**:  
**Compute that proves integrity without disclosure.**

---

## 🔒 Core Trust Model

Warhollow introduces two foundational concepts:

### **HRS — Hardware-Rooted Sovereignty**  
Hardware identity is the trust anchor.  
Boot, integrity, and attestation are enforced locally — never through a cloud provider.

### **HME — Hardened Machine Environment**  
A physically single-tenant, operator-controlled execution boundary with deterministic, inspectable behavior.

Together, HRS + HME define:  
> **Sovereignty delivered as silicon.**

## 🛡 Key Properties

- **Operator-exclusive control** — No hyperscalers, no shared tenants, no delegated IAM.  
- **TPM-bound identity (minimal usage)** — Hardware identity for integrity, not cloud trust enforcement.  
- **Zero cloud dependency** — Fully offline-capable.  
- **Encrypted, isolated workloads** — AI, agents, and cryptographic operations under the operator’s keys only.  
- **Proof-of-integrity** — Optional cryptographic attestations for lifecycle events and workloads.  
- **Jurisdictional containment** — Infrastructure aligned with the operator’s legal domain.

---

## 🤖 AI + Cryptographic Integration

- **Private Intelligence** — LLMs and agents that operate under your keys alone.  
- **Encrypted LLM Execution** — Hardware-sealed isolation for generative and analytic models.  
- **Verifiable Compute** — Every workload can sign its own existence, state, and lifecycle.  
- **Optional Proof-of-Compute Ledger** — A cryptographic audit trail for transactional or inferential logic.
