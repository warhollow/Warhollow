# Warhollow Tiers

This document defines the current tier model for Warhollow.
It reflects design intent and roadmap direction, not a final pricing or SLA commitment.

Warhollow environments are always:
- Tenant-isolated
- Operator-controlled
- Private by default
- Designed to minimize exposed surface area

The tiers below describe how much structure, governance, and assurance is applied on top of that baseline.

---

## Ghost [Ephemeral Protection]

**Minimal presence. Maximum discretion.**

Ghost is designed for builders and operators who want a secure, private environment without ceremony.
It favors simplicity, low footprint, and operator control.

### Characteristics 
- Isolated environment/enforced by virtualization
- Private-by-default access paths
- Key-based access control
- Manual snapshots and exports
- Minimal observability

Ghost is intentionally quiet.
It does not assume teams, persistence, or long-term retention.

---

## Shadow [Shielded Operation]

**Operational, deliberate, and repeatable.**

Shadow is intended for real workloads that require consistency and visibility without sacrificing sovereignty.

### Characteristics
- Multiple environments or isolated cells
- Role-based access control
- Scheduled snapshots and retention policies
- Standard observability and audit-friendly logs
- Template-based provisioning

Shadow favors predictability.
It makes it possible to answer basic operational questions without introducing bureaucracy.

## Sentinel [Protective Oversight]

**Governed environments inside the perimeter.**

Sentinel is designed for workloads that require active protection, enforced boundaries, and provable control.

Sentinel environments operate with stronger access rules, clearer audit trails, and deliberate change management.

### Characteristics
- Enforced access controls and strong authentication options
- Governance-aware change management
- Hardened execution boundaries
- Exportable audit records
- Tested recovery workflows

Sentinel favors assurance.
It is intended for high-stakes or sensitive workloads where visibility and recovery matter as much as uptime.

## The Warhollow Framework

Regardless of tier:
- No opaque infrastructure
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Deliberate, reversible change

Warhollow prioritizes control, discretion, and clarity.
