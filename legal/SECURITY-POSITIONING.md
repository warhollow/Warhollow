# Warhollow Security Positioning Statement

Warhollow does *not* claim formal certification under frameworks such as SOC 2,
ISO 27001, FedRAMP, or equivalents.

Warhollow follows architectural principles *informed* by recognized secure design
concepts, including:

- hardware identity as a trust root  
- least-privilege and minimal dependency models  
- physical compute isolation  
- deterministic machine behavior  
- operator-controlled boot integrity  
- strict separation of hardware trust and workload confidentiality  

This does not represent or imply certification under any standard.
